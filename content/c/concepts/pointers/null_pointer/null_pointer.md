**An integer constant expression with the value 0, or such an expression cast to type void \***, is called a null pointer constant. If a null pointer constant is converted to a pointer type, the resulting pointer, called a null pointer, is guaranteed to be compared unequally to a pointer to any object or function.

##SYNTAX

```
type pointer_name = NULL;
type pointer_name = 0;
```
type pointer_name = NULL;
type pointer_name = 0;


## Understanding Null Pointer

- Null pointer does not point anything.
- Null pointer constant value is 0.
- A null pointer is guaranteed to compare unequal to any pointer that points to a valid object.

## Uses of Null Pointer

Following are some most common uses of the NULL pointer in C:

1. To initialize a pointer variable when that pointer variable hasn’t been assigned any valid memory address yet.
2. To check for a null pointer before accessing any pointer variable. By doing so, we can perform error handling in pointer-related code, e.g., dereference a pointer variable only if it’s not NULL.
3. To pass a null pointer to a function argument when we don’t want to pass any valid memory address.
4. A NULL pointer is used in data structures like trees, linked lists, etc. to indicate the end.

** We can check whether null pointer value is null or not by using isequal (==) operator **

## Declaration of Null Pointer

Declaration of null pointer same as the pointer valrible

```
int* pointer = NULL;

```
NULL must be all uppercase letters


## EXAMPLE 1

```

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
 int *ptr = NULL; // ptr is a null pointer
 if (ptr == NULL) {
 printf("Pointer is null.\n");
 }
 return 0;
}

```

## output

If the pointer is null pointer print the statement in printf() otherwise nothing will be printed



## EXAMPLE 2

```
// C NULL pointer demonstration

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
 // declaring null pointer
 int* ptr = NULL;

 // derefencing only if the pointer has any value
 if (ptr == NULL) {
 printf("Pointer does not point to anything");
 }
 else {
 printf("Value pointed by pointer: %d", *ptr);
 }
 return 0;
}

```
## output

```
Pointer does not point to anything

```

## Common Issues with Null Pointers

While null pointers are useful, improper handling can lead to significant issues:

1. **Null Pointer Dereference**
 Dereferencing a null pointer is an undefined behavior and often leads to program crashes or segmentation faults.
 ```
 int *ptr = NULL;
 *ptr = 10; // Undefined behavior
 ```
2. **Accidental Null Pointer Access**
--Sometimes, logic errors in a program can result in an attempt to access or modify data through a null pointer.

3. **Difficult Debugging**
--Null pointer errors can be hard to debug, especially in large codebases, because they often manifest as crashes without clear error messages.

## Best Practices for Handling Null Pointers
To avoid issues with null pointers, programmers should follow best practices:

1. **Explicitly Initialize Pointers**
--Always initialize pointers to a known value, preferably NULL or nullptr.

```
int *ptr = NULL;
```

2. **Check for Null Before Dereferencing**
 Always check if a pointer is null before attempting to dereference it.
 ```
 if (ptr != NULL) {
 *ptr = 10;
 }
 ```
    
4. **Enable Compiler Warnings**
 Modern compilers can warn about potential null pointer dereferences. Enable these warnings and address them promptly.
